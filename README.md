## Vagrant Setup

Make sure your system has [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed. After this, download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) for your system.
Install the Vagrant Reload plugin by ```vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload```

---

## VM Config
The Vagrantfile will create a VirtualBox VM with the following configuration
```
RAM = 3072 MB
CPUs = 2
VRAM = 32 MB
Clipboard = Bi-Directional
username:vagrant
password:vagrant
```
The main Windows 10 build is based upon the  VagrantBox created by [CyberDefenders](https://app.vagrantup.com/cyberdefenders/boxes/win10)


Upon VM Creation, the following occurs:
* ShutUp 10 is installed and configures Windows10 to reduce the noise of the network
* **Chocolatey is installed which installs the following packages**
  * Wireshark
  * WinPCAP
  * Network Monitor
  * Chromium
  * Firefox
  * Java 8
  * Visual C++ Redis
  * Sysinternals
  * Fiddler
  * x64dbg
  * IDA Free
  * 7-zip
  * Python 3
  * Yara
  * Process Hacker
  * IL Spy
  * .Net 5
  * Office Pro Plus 2013 Eval
  * Brave Browser
  * Notepad++

## VM Creation

* Clone the repository
  
  ```git
  git clone https://github.com/sandmaxprime/VagrantMalwareWin10VM.git
  ```
* Using terminal, navigate to the repository folder containing the VagrantFile and then ```vagrant up```

* This will then download the box file - This will take some time
* Post the download, the VM will be created and the provisioning will begin to install the packages.

Certain code pieces are based on [Chris Long's](https://twitter.com/Centurion) Github Repo [DetectionLab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab/). It helped me get a good understanding on the creation of Vagrant machines
